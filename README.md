# GitHub to Portfolio

Generate a beautifully designed portfolio template in minutes by connecting your GitHub.

Try it out [here](https://github-to-portfolio.vercel.app/)

## How it works

The user connects their GitHub by logging in via oAuth. The app only requests permission to view public data (profile and repositories). Once logged in, you will be redirected to the this site, where we then leverage the GitHub REST API to fetch your public data.

Once your data has been retrieved, it is shown in a portfolio template.
